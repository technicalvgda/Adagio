The Song of Tikkun - III

	And the First Born met their creator, and He them, and they shared great joy in 
the moment of the First Creation. And with their songs joined they created the fabric of 
the firmament, and all the lamps and light therein, and they delighted in the beauty that 
had filled the void.
	Then the Eternal One turned to the First Born and said, 'Shall we alone enjoy the 
wonders of creation? Let the dust of the firmament form its spheres, and above one let 
us place a vault of sky. Then, let us send forth our Song, so that great wonders may take 
shape, and those in our image may love and delight in them.'
	And so they sang a Song of Creation, more lush and beautiful than they ever had 
before. Two great lamps formed within the vault of the sky, one which presided by day, 
the other, night. And from the earth formed great mountains and deep seas, thick forests 
and fertile plains, and from them came rushing waters, gentle streams, rolling hills and 
ridges of fire. Throughout the land was bursting the fruits of the tree and vine, the leaf of 
the stalk and the root of the earth. Flowers of all shapes and colors bloomed, and their 
sweet scents was carried on the breeze and filled the vault of the sky.

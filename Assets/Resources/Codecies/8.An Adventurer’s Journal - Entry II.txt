Year 1, Month 5, Day 4

I returned to the Cave of the Samara to pray to you, my goddess Splendor. One of 
flames, happiness, our protector from the Evil Ones. I pray to you, red goddess 
Splendor. I hear you favor festivities and though I am alone on my pilgrimages, I dance 
to your statue the most. Singing and dancing the Great Song, I pray for the happiness, 
safety, and protection of my home village.

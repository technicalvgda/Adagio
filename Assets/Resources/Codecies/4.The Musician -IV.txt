No measure of time in these caves,
I can feel myself fading slowly into this lost world,
My skin less and less opaque, becoming an echo,
Like the grim melodies my fingers release into this darkness.
It is a beautiful tomb I've stumbled into. 
Buried here with the gods of old.
If only I could bring this beauty back to my kin.

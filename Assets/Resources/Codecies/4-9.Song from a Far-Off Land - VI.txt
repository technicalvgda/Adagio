Song from a Far-Off Land - VI

The demons were too many
She could not go on.
With dying breath and shadowed eyes she saw
As light faded and the mountain top grew cold again,
Her efforts had not been wasted, her message was received
And before her, the chain of fire snaked across the mountains
Hope burning through the night.

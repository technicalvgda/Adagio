Passion’s Gift

From Passion's operatic voice the flame was born, and she filled the world with her 
warmth. As she watched the Second Born frolic in the lush world, she decided to gift 
them with her greatest attribute—the manipulation of flames. She taught them to use fire 
to light their paths, protect from cold and prepare their food. Passion delighted in how 
the Second Born benefited from her gift. But after the First Lamentation, Passion no 
longer desired to share her fire and she withheld it from the Third Born. It was not until 
Splendor stole her fire and turned it against her, that the Third Born were granted the 
gift.

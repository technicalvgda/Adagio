Xun ran along the weathered path into the woods
Until she reached a pass, the foot of the mountain
There nestled was an ancient gate, guarded through the ages
By ancient statues of ancient heroes of the land
Of Xun’s grandmother and her grandmother’s grandmother
Here she stopped to catch her breath
To clutch the single arrow, the one that took her love’s life
But as the demons grew grotesque in number
They followed after her like wind through woods

The Musician -II

The walls of this rocky palace show our history. 
All of our lost days. The forgotten legends. The gods.
It feels real again. All the stories from my youth,
Brought back before my eyes in the dim light of these halls.
The music flows endlessly around me, mixing with my own.
I find myself compelled to remain. For nothing outside compares.

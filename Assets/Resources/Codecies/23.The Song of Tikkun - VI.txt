The Song of Tikkun - VI

	The First Born wandered the smoldering earth underneath the blackened sky for 
ages uncounted. They looked in vain for remnants of their Song on the wind and in the 
narrow places. They cried bitter tears as they came upon the ashes of their beloved 
creatures, all save for Passion, whose heart despaired and began to grow dark.
	Their hope was nearly spent, until again they combed the base of a mighty ridge 
that formed the eastern wall of a valley. At the base of its tallest peak, behind a winding 
natural stair, they found the entrance to a cave, never before discovered. They moved 
through its darkness, and in the air they felt the narrow place expand, and they 
perceived that they were in an open space. A vast vault was before and above them, 
and strands of broken moonlight fell down into the chasm. Winding halls went ever 
outward from its center. The First Born were still and listened closely. Then Composure's 
eyes flew open and she said, 'Sisters it is faint but it is here, the echo of our Song 
endures.' They moved swiftly, until at last they found the long sought remnants, its notes 
lingering in the subtle cavern winds. And they cried out in a joy that had not been heard 
in all the firmament since the dawn of creation.

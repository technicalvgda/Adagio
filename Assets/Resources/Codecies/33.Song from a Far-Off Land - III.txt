Song from a Far-Off Land - III

The mountains held an ancient temple, and the temple held an ancient brazier 
The first of a chain of signal fires that snaked across the land
Two hundred years the braziers had sat cold
But from her grandmother, and her grandmother's grandmother
The story of the fires had been passed.
Xun plucked the single arrow from her lover's side
And took up her bow

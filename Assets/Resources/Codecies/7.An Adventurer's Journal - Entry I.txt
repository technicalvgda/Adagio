Year 1, Month 3, Day 1

Today I found the Cave of the Samara. The Supreme Three who saved our world from 
the Evil Ones and banished them forever. I sought out my favored, our shield and 
protector, Splendor. She stole the flames of Passion and gave it back to us, humanity. 
The fire burns in us all, so long we give our praise to the one of flames, Splendor’s 
flames. Now, I must wish, hope, pray for the pursuit of happiness for the future. For my 
future, I pray to you, my goddess Splendor.

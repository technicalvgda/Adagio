The Song of Tikkun - VIII

	Then Grace stepped forward and she raised her hand aloft. A great light shone 
from her palm, and she touched the Third Born upon their brows, and they awoke. 
'Welcome, Third Born, do not be afraid! Here you awake in the heart of creation. We are 
the Nine, the First Born, the emanations of the Eternal One. You are in our halls, where 
all is full of music. Here we have fashioned you by its living waters, and lay you upon its 
verdant grasses, so that you may delight in the glory of creation and partake in its 
renewal.' So the First and Third Born met in happiness, and Order took out her scroll and 
rewrote the Law, so that the waters would flow in their proper places, that root and 
branch would grow earthward and skyward, that night was night and day was day. The 
cycles of Creation were renewed.

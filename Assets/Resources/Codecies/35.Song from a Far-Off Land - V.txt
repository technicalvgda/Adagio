Song from a Far-Off Land - V

At long last Xun stood at the foot of the temple
Snow falling softly on this sacred, solitary place
And the brazier stood before her, perched atop its tower
Standing in the cold of two hundred years forgotten
She nocked the arrow that had killed her lover, set it alight
And sent it flying true, into the pyre
The flame arose and bathed the stone with light and warmth
And the signal was lit
But victory was not yet assured
And demons are not beaten quite so easy

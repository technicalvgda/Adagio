	The Third Born rejoiced in the cool waters, they delighted in the fruits of the tree 
and vine, and with the birds and the First Born they lifted up their voices in a Song of 
Creation. And Passion watched all this and in her heart burned an unquenchable flame, 
and it burned her until she blackened, until her undying thirst was all she knew. “The 
Third Born are beautiful and dear, and their sweet voices sing the Song of Creation. Yet 
they live without the presence of the Eternal One, and face only darkness. No matter the 
beauty, no matter the glory, all will end in darkness and in death, and they will never 
know the love of the Eternal One as we have, for they cannot be present in His power. It 
is cruel that they were ever created, and if we love them, we will undo them.’ And she 
turned the hearts of Dignity and Composure, and they believed in the folly of the Third 
Born, and they beckoned their sisters to the mouth of the cave, and they shared with 
them their design.

The Song of Tikkun - II

	He set forth his emanations, his Song of Creation, into the void, and there came 
into form the aspects of His being, the First Born. Grace was born tall and mantled with 
light, shining as the Steadfast star. Order came forth spinning wheels within wheels, and 
Splendor sprung from the void in her chariot, her many arms dancing. Truth was born 
with a face shining like the surface of a deep pool. Freedom came forth laughing brightly, 
and from her laughter came the spark of renewal. Unity was born with her many braids 
hung like jewels, and Dignity appeared tall and grave with a scepter of light. Composure 
came forth crystalline, singing with her eyes closed, and Passion's voice was sweetest of 
all, and she was surrounded by tongues of flame.

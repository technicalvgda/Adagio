Freedom so loved the nature of the world, she gifted to animals the ability to survive, 
which she called instinct. With instinct, they could care for themselves and flourish. 
Seeing how it benefitted them, she gifted instinct to the Second and Third Born in each 
incarnation. With instinct, they kept safe from harm and nurtured each other. Freedom 
felt she had acted in their best interest, and left them to govern themselves as they saw 
fit.

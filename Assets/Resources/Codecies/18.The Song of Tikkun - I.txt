	Before the beginning, before the world was born, there were no heavens, no 
earth, no space or form, there was only the Eternal One, and He was One, and all and 
everything there was. And He dwelt in and of Himself and hummed and sang into 
eternity, and He knew no want or yearning.
	He weaved His song for eons unnumbered. Yet a desire, like a slow burn, began 
to fill Him, until He awakened to His emptiness. No longer could He be content singing 
alone. So He devised a Song of Creation, and He lifted up His voice, but there was no 
form, no life, that could spring where He dwelt. He was all things and alone.
	Yet His desire burned Him still and He would not be deterred. So with all His 
might He sundered a part of Himself from Himself. His voice cried out so it shook Him, 
and in the place where He was sundered there was a void, and He was pleased.

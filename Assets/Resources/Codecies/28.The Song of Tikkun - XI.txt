	Suddenly the Sun was blotted out, and a veil of shadow swept across the valley. 
Splendor, terrible and fair, rode her chariot with her many arms brandishing fire, and she 
drove her dark sisters far from the heart of creation. She then took the form of a great 
serpent and she lay at the base of the mountain for forty days and forty nights. Order 
spun her wheels within wheels and she sealed the valley by holding back the sky. Grace 
stood to her full height and outstretched her arms, and from her brow issued the light of 
the Steadfast star, so that nothing could creep in the shadows that had designs on the 
Third Born. It was the First Rescue, and the First Betrayal.
	Truth, Unity and Freedom cried out, ‘What have you done!’ And Truth came 
before them and she lead her remaining sisters in a cold fury: ‘You have dishonored our 
sacred trust, you have done the unthinkable by surprising our sisters and banishing them 
from the heart of creation with fire and malice, without deliberation, without accord. We 
will leave this place, and find our own way to heed the call of our creator, for you are 
blacker than our sisters ever were, and with you there can be no faith.’

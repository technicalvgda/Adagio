The Song of Tikkun - X

	Grace, Order and Splendor were astonished. They condemned their sisters and 
wondered how their hearts had grown so dark. Passion, Dignity and Composure stood 
gravely, and vouched for their solution, and they looked upon their sister Grace, and 
questioned her will to compassion. Truth, Unity and Freedom listened in silence to the 
dispute, until Truth raised up her shining face and said: 'Enough. We see the merit in 
both sides. There is truth and unity and freedom in both life and in death. Let us spend 
the night in contemplation. In the morning we will return here, and here we will deliberate 
and offer counsel, and together, we will act in one accord.' And Grace, Order and 
Splendor knew then the peril that was all too near, and they moved to protect the Third 
Born.
	When the appointed hour came, Grace, Order and Splendor asked forgiveness 
for their harsh words, and they requested time to walk under the sky and gather their 
thoughts. Their sisters forgave them and granted their request, and they seated 
themselves at the stair that lead to the mouth of the cave, and they rested under the light 
of midday, and waited.

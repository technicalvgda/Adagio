	And so they rewove the Song they had sung with their creator, and they made it 
anew, and throughout the cave came bursting forth new life. Soft grasses and trees 
laden with fruits formed alongside silver pools, ivy hung on stalactites and flowers 
blossomed in every crevice, the Sun healed and its gentle rays fell through the clefts in 
the vault onto creation below. The birds and the fish and the beasts were restored, and 
they sang among the trees and swam in the waters, they grazed and rested peacefully 
under bough and by brook, and the First Born were filled with a tearful delight.
	Then they focused on the Song once more, and from their throats emitted 
a resounding hum. They put forth all their thought, all their life, all their being into their 
music, and from them again came the sublime melody from which their image drew form. 
And the Third Born lay beside the living waters and they were peaceful and at rest.

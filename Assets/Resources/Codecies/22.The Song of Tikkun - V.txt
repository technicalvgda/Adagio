	Yet The Eternal One did not know His strength. As He entered the world the vault of the 
sky burned, the forests withered and fell away, the plains were scorched, the waters ran 
dry, and all the fish and beasts and birds, and all the Second Born were turned to dust. 
The garden world became barren rock before their eyes, and The Eternal One and the 
First Born cried out in horror, in a terrible sound that had never before entered the void, 
and their cries echoed throughout the firmament. Their tears replenished the waters and 
their sighs the wind, yet it did nothing to replenish the earth. They rent themselves and 
grieved. It was the First Lamentation.
	The Eternal one said to the First Born: ‘I am weary from birthing and by sorrow 
am I undone. It was not you who destroyed our world. Go. Search for any remnants of 
our Song that may yet linger and restore creation. I cannot bear what I have done and I 
can brook no peril to life. I will go, I will exile myself, I will leave the vault of the sky and 
all the firmament, so that I may not again destroy what I love best. If you succeed, if 
there be any Third Born, let them know my Face, so that they might remember me.’
	Bitter was the sorrow at the parting of the First Born and The Eternal One, for 
none knew when again they might sing together among the lights of the firmament, and 
they grieved anew. And when their parting was done, all Nine of the First Born 
descended, and The Eternal One withdrew, and He never again dwelt in creation.

From void, the Source creates the world with flowing melody. 
Nine fractured aspects bring forth life to the wasteland, 
Bearing each their own vibrant representation of their origin.
The nine remain in the realm of man as the One recedes,
Left to guide forth the melodies of the Earth.
Yet nine divided voices make not a whole.

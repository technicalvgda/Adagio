Year 2, Month 8, Day 20

Has the song of the Samara grown weak in my ears? I can no longer hear its song...I 
have wished, hoped, prayed to the goddess Splendor, yet my village still faces famine 
and unhappiness. Have I been praying to the wrong goddess? No, it is not that. 

I cannot forsake my goddess, Splendor. I pray to my goddess, Splendor, once more. I 
must not give into despair. Please hear my cry, my red goddess Splendor, eldest of the 
Samara. Save my people.

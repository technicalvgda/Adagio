	Grace, Order and Splendor were grieved but resolved, and they declared that as 
the Eternal One would brook no threat to life, neither would they. And this turned their 
remaining sisters from them all the more, for they did not perceive in them remorse or 
reconciliation, and Truth lead Freedom and Unity out of the valley, never to return.
	The Last of the First Born returned to the heart of creation, and they beheld the 
Third Born cowering in fear. And Grace outstretched her arms and cried, ‘Do not be 
afraid, the danger has passed! Come out from behind stone and tree, and hear us!’ And 
she beckoned the Third Born and her sisters to the edge of the waters, and there they 
met under the rays of the morning.

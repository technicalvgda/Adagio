The Song of Tikkun - IV

	Then came from the Song the beasts of the field and forest, the fish of the sea 
and the birds of the sky, and they were a great delight to the Eternal One and the First 
Born. They were loved by all, by none more than Freedom, who sang with the sparrows 
and ran with the deer.
	Finally the Song ebbed into a slow and steady hum, and the Eternal One and the 
First Born were One in its rhythm. As they swayed they felt a quickening, and from their 
voices issued a melody like nothing before that had come into the void, and from this 
music came the Second Born, made in their image. They were awake, with all the 
aspects of the Eternal One in their being, and a joy sublime rang out in the firmament.
	The Eternal One and the First Born watched the Second Born enjoy the garden 
world, and they rejoiced over all they had wrought. So in joy were they that they moved 
to join creation, to live among the Second Born under the vault of the sky and make 
music with them. They descended earthward, and The Eternal One with his great voice 
cried out, 'Hear us, Second Born! Watch for the morning, for it has come! Out of the 
depths we have made you, and we are One!'

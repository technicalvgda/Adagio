Disheartened by betrayal, Truth wanders the world of man, 
Flanked for a time by Unity and Freedom,
Yet slowly in realization of their sister's loss of hope,
The two depart on their own sad journeys.
Yet Truth wanders on, glancing in each mirrored pool she passes,
Hoping evermore to catch a glimpse of the gods' former perfection.

	Grace stood tall and queenly in her starry mantle, and her voice was clear and 
bright as the living waters, ‘Nine you saw leaving, and Three you see return. Three there 
will remain. Yet all is not lost. Henceforth we will be called The Samara, for we stand as 
your guardians from out of the heart of creation. And this place will be called Tikkun, for 
here you will continue to learn Songs of Creation, and together we will heal this fractured 
world.’
	‘And as our world heals you may in time wish to venture out. This we honor and 
praise, yet we ask that you do not forget. Do not forsake us, and we will not diminish, but 
be ever your friend and your rescue. Remember that you are the Third Born, remember 
for what you were made, and do not be tempted into despair. And when you look for your 
help, call to us, and we will come.’”

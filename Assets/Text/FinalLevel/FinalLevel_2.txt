ORDER:Perhaps this world is not for her, she seeks to tear it apart at the seams. 
For this to go on means to abandon all of life to destruction and misery, not just humanity.
And not just this small human.
I feel… I feel we should depart. If only for a time.
Humanity does not deserve the agony of us casting the world into disorder once more. 
Maybe it is best we leave.@ 
GRACE:Do not give into despair! Remember what drove our sisters into darkness!
Remember how we wandered, remember when all seemed lost
We found the last remnants of the Songs and we made the world anew 
Do not lose faith in the cycles of creation!
Let this one bring our message, let the Thirdborn remember!

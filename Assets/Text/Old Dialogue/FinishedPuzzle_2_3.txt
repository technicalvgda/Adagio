GRACE:The song, the song is so faint...
Where is the flame? Where is the starlight, the living waters
His wonders We restored...Where have they gone?@
GRACE:We remember....we remember...?@
GRACE:...a great cry and a moaning rose up from the dust
...Oh!@
GRACE:......
We are whole. We are Grace.@
GRACE:We remember.

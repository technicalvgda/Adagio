ORDER:We formed you here, human of the Thirdborn.
We three, the Samara. We waited for you here.
You did not come. We lost hope.@
ORDER:The others faded away. My sisters. Their songs are silent.
I had thought my own silent, too. Our great gamble, a failure.@
ORDER:But you have restored order, little monk.
There could be hope still.

NPC:I did not predict that you would come.
It has been years since someone? Something?
Never came.@
Zimri:I...
My name is Zimri.
I am a monk, and I read of this place in a scroll
And I came to see if it was real.@
NPC:The cave, crumbled, broken.
We were sure the way was sealed. We are lost.
We could not be discovered... unless...
It speaks?@
Zimri:I didn’t mean to intrude, I didn’t know...@
NPC:Sentient.
Legs-- two.
Sentient... human? Yes, human.
Our... my creation. The great gamble, that we... lost? 
But you are here.
Potential. Useful.@
Zimri:I am a human, a monk. Or I was,
The rest of the order didn’t believe this place existed,
The cave of songs, of creation, from the ancient legends.
But I wanted to know the truth.
And so I left, and came here.@
NPC:But it functions, does it not?
No? No. No it.. It’s not..
The grace of these stones are not what they used to... I.. we.
We? I cannot. It is just stone.
This mountain... soundless and lifeless stone. 
...
But you, humanity. You can help. Yes.@
Zimri:I heard songs, as a child, of the creators
Three sisters, Order, Grace and Splendor
Could they be... is that you?@
NPC:Who are.. We?
Am I. Yes.
We, The Samara. I, Order.
Order, a name in your words.
Order, law. This I re-wove. This I created.
This... you have not yet forgotten, I know, because I linger still. 
The other songs... silence. The instrument in shambles, disrepair.@
Zimri:I... would help you, if I’m able?
You said humanity could help, perhaps this could be fixed.
Please, tell me what I can do.@
NPC:Courage. Unexpected, unplanned.
A variable that may change in our favor.
The instrument is vast, and we are lost within it.
Restore the song, and we may aid one another.
Once, we aided each other... but the silence...
You may venture into the cave. Repair the instrument.
Very well. Go forth, humanity.@
Zimri:

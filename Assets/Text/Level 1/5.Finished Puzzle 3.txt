NPC:We formed you here, human of the Thirdborn.
We three, the Samara. We waited for you here.
You did not come. We lost hope.
The others faded away. My sisters. Their songs are silent.
I had thought my own silent, too. Our great gamble, a failure.
But you have restored order, little monk. 
There could be hope still.@

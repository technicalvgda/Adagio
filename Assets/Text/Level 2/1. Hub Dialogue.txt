NPC:Everything has been made clear, the path is open.
A thousand complete, individual steps.
Yes. It is all where it should be...
Tell me, Determined one, how does your world function?
Why had you abandoned us to this fate?@
Zimri: 
I didn't... I don't think they knew.
When I decided to leave the monastery
They called me a fool for chasing the songs
They said there was no value in music, only study.
But I was right, and they are the fools
For all the destruction they've caused to this place@
NPC:There is value in study, in tradition, in discipline.
You were designed to take solace in the order of things.
It is not a failing to heed the rules of your world
As you seem loathe to do, Determined one.
Only to follow blindly
With no thought to why they are in place.@
Zimri:But they don't think! They follow blindly!
They would not listen, no matter what I said
And they left me no choice but to find truth on my own!
Just look at what they've done--@
NPC:Your anger blinds you, child. Think.
If they have forgotten as you say, they did not know
The ruin that forgetting had cast upon us.
There is no blame to be placed, that will not help.
Only problems to be solved, wrongs to be righted.
I cannot stand alone, that is not the way of the Samara.
We were three, once, but I have not heard their songs
Since the ages when humanity still walked these halls.
Hidden within the winding paths of this instrument sleeps Grace.
Sleeps? No.. not sleeping. Not singing.
She will help. If she can be found.
Can you hear the way?
Good, you have my trust.@

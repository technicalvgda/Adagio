NPC:Nothing, emptiness, stillness, no thing but Her
holding on, muted, pained, gripping, gripping onto the song
a hard knot tightens, and then you….
And She, there! She lingers….dim…
no brilliance, no majesty, no dancing arms in flame…
a cold fury, a gripping, no mouth, no voice, no music
her glory diminished her will undone why has this happened to us?
What went wrong?@

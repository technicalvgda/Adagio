GRACE:Nothing, emptiness, stillness, nothing but Her
holding on, muted, pained, gripping, gripping onto the song
a hard knot tightens, and then you...@
GRACE:And She, there! She lingers...dim...
no brilliance, no majesty, no dancing arms in flame...
a cold fury, a gripping, no mouth, no voice, no music
her glory diminished her will undone why has this happened to us?
What went wrong?

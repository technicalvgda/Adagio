GRACE:Emptiness, stillness, nothing but her
holding on, muted, pained, gripping, gripping...
a hard knot tightens, and then you...@
GRACE:And she... there! She lingers...dim...
no brilliance, no majesty, no dancing arms wreathed in flame...
A cold fury, pursing mouth, no voice, no music.
Her glory diminished, her will undone. Why has this happened to us?
What went wrong?

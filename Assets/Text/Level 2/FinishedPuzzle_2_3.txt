GRACE:The song...the song is so faint...
Where is the flame? Where is the starlight, the living waters?
His wonders we restored...Where have they gone?@
GRACE:We remember....we remember...@
GRACE:...A great cry and a moaning rose up from the dust
...Oh! OH!@
GRACE:......
And so it is.
I am whole. 
I am Grace.
I remember. 
Come to me.

ORDER:Everything has been made clear, the path is open.
A thousand complete, individual steps.@
ORDER:Yes. It is all where it should be...
Tell me, Determined one, how does your world function?
Why had you abandoned us to this fate?@
ZIMRI:I didn't... I don't think they knew.@
ZIMRI:When I decided to leave the monastery,
They called me a fool for chasing the songs.
They said there was no value in music, only study.@
ZIMRI:But I was right, and they are the fools
for all the destruction they've caused to this place@
ORDER:There is value in study, in tradition, in discipline.
You were designed to take solace in the order of things.@
ORDER:It is not a failing to heed the rules of your world
as you seem loathe to do, Determined one.
Only to follow blindly
With no thought to why they are in place.@
ZIMRI:But they don't think! They follow blindly!@
ZIMRI:They would not listen, no matter what I said
and they left me no choice but to find truth on my own!
Just look at what they've done--@
ORDER:Your anger blinds you, child. Think.
If they have forgotten as you say, they did not know
the ruin that forgetting had cast upon us.@
ORDER:There is no blame to be placed, that will not help.
Only problems to be solved, wrongs to be righted.@
ORDER:I cannot stand alone, that is not the way of the Samara.
We were three, once, but I have not heard their songs
since the ages when humanity still walked these halls.@
ORDER:Hidden within the winding paths of this instrument sleeps Grace.
Sleeps? No.. not sleeping. Not singing.@
ORDER:She will help. If she can be found.
Can you hear the way?@
ORDER:Good, you have my trust.

ORDER:You have repaired a portion of the instrument. Another path opens.
You must go. Yet for a moment, I must be the curious one. 
It is clear now why we are fading. You were forbidden from seeking us, 
yet you came anyway. Why?@
ZIMRI:I… don’t know. I was always taught that the gods were idealizations 
we strove to emulate, not actual beings. My order prized discipline, duty, 
and law above all else.@
ZIMRI:But something in the scroll spoke to me. I... I tried to live a good 
and moral life, to follow the code as I was taught. But I couldn't ignore 
what I had found, not if there was a chance it was true.@
ORDER:There is value in study, in tradition, in discipline.
You were designed to take solace in the order of things.@
ORDER:It is not a failing to heed the laws of your world, curious one. 
It is only when you follow without discernment that you go astray.@
ZIMRI:To think of all we've lost by forgetting this place, 
by forgetting you...why?What happened? Why bury the knowledge 
in ancient libraries and deny it to ourselves, to others?@
ORDER:You have many questions. Perhaps some will be answered. 
For now, you must continue on. My sisters are still silent.
The door is open.
